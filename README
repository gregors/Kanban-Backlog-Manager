== Kanban Backlog Manager

This is a tool to manage backlogs of user stories. Intended mainly for Kanban, but could be used for Scrum, too. One of the main features is the possibility to print very nice story cards. 

The tool is written in Rails 3.

Disclaimer: this is just an early stage prototype and probably does not suffice even our own coding standards. 

== Getting Started

bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

open localhost:3000/stories/
